# Pokemon API card with React Native and Expo

This project is a very simple app and has no functionality for actually playing anything yet. The main goal of this was to learn and practice API fetching, promises, states and some calculations for position of components.

I don't have plans of finishing it as a playable game. Also, there are some known visual bugs like cards not placing on top of each other correctly when played, but I'm not changing it soon. I'll move on to my next project as this one was already nice enought for what it was meant.

Some ideas I have for features:
- 3 turns where sum of attacks will win the round (pretty much like gwent)
- You can play cards until you or the opp pass (pretty much like gwent)
- Special effects for pokemons (e.g: chansey has low attack, but it could add 25% atk to allies; Mewtwo could burn 1 random opp card)
- Sinergies for element types (something like auto chess, eg: 3 psychic could force pass)
- Something around pokemons evolutions

Well, those are just some ideas anyway, but I shouldn't lose focus so I'm moving on.

P.s: this app was only tested on an physical iPhone 8 and has some workarounds for it.

Suggestions and advices are always welcomed!
